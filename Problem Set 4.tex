To build the folded cascade OTA, I began by sizing transistors M0, M1, and M2 (see figure \ref{b2_schem} for instance names). Because I want $160\mu A$ through transistor M9 and that transistor is sized with $W = 42\mu m$ and I want $320\mu A$ through transistor M2, I sized M2 at $84\mu A$. For the sake of convenience, I decided to use a $320\mu A$ current source so I sized transistors M0 and M1 at $84\mu A$ as well. In addition, because I will eventually put this circuit into feedback and I would like my output to be close to mid-rail, I set $V_{cm} = 800mV$ which is close to the ceiling of input voltage. This is an acceptable value because the small signal input will never be above 1V.

To bias $V_{b1}$, $V_{b2}$, and $V_{b3}$ I utilized two branches of self-biasing current mirrors (see Figure \ref{b2_schem}). The first branch, which consists of one PMOS and four NMOS transistors, serves a number of purposes. The PFET (M21) mirrors current from M0 and cuts it in half (sized $42\mu A$). The four NMOS receive the $~160\mu A$ of current and are sized as follows. M28 will have half the current of M14 and its gate voltage will bias $V_{b1}$ so it must be half the width of M14, $10.5\mu m$. M29 will have the same current as M13 and its gate voltage will bias $V_{b2}$ so it must be the same width as M13, $10.5\mu A$. M27 will also take the same width as M29 and M28. M20 will take one third of that width. Using a very similar methodology, I built the second self-biasing current mirror branch but this time mirroring the current with an NMOS and receiving the current with four PMOS transistors. M31 mirrors the current of $160\mu A$ so it is sized the same as M28. M44, M45, and M40 will all have the same current as M10 and the gate of M45 will bias $V_{b3}$ so they are all sized the same as M10 at $42\mu A$. M4 is sized one third of that. As can be seen in Figure \ref{b2_dcop}, the biasing is successful.

I performed a DC sweep of $V_{out-OL}$ against $V_{in-OTA}$ with the OTA in stand alone and the expected transfer function for a differential amplifier is attained (see Figure \ref{b3}).

\section{Bullet Point 4}
I applied a small-signal differential input as well as some DC feedback circuitry in order to simulate the open loop gain. Because the open loop gain does not consider small signal feedback, I wanted to build a  circuit that would block all AC feedback. However, I wanted to use this feedback to bias $V_{cm}$. To do this I implemented an RC lowpass filter with a negligible cutoff voltage as can be seen in Figure \ref{b4_schem}. I performed an AC simulation of the open loop gain of the circuit (see Figure \ref{b4_bode}) and was able to attain $A(s) = 521.19\frac{V}{V} = 54.34dB$. Please note that since transistor M44 does not directly affect the biasing, I was able to reduce its size to $~16\mu A$ and optimize my gain.

From the phase plot of my optimized open loop circuit (Figure \ref{b4_bode}), I estimate that there are poles at $~227kHz$ and $471MHz$ and a zero at 945MHz. I estimate the gain-bandwidth product (taken at -3dB from the maximum gain) to be $~72.2MHz$.

\section{Bullet Point 6}
I placed my OTA in AC feedback as shown in Figure \ref{b6_schem} with $V_{cm} = 0.8V$. To find the feedback factor, $\beta$, from this configuration, I plotted the current through the feedback resistor over the voltage at the output (see Figure \ref{b6_beta}).

\begin{equation}
\beta = \frac{I_f}{v_{out}}
\end{equation}

From my simulation, I attained a value of $\beta = 0.577mA/V$. This is comparable to the ideal value of

\begin{equation}
\beta_{ideal} = \frac{1}{R_f} = 0.4mA/V
\end{equation}

\section{Bullet Point 10}
With an ideal op-amp (infinite gain and bandwidth), a small-signal step at the input should cause an immediate small-signal step at the output. The reason for this is that with infinite bandwidth, $\tau$ is defined as

\begin{equation}
\tau = \frac{1}{2\pi f_{3dB}} = \infty.
\end{equation}

To determine the output function, we use the equation

\begin{equation}
v_{OUT} = \mu (t) \{1-e^{\frac{-t}{\tau}}\} = \mu (t).
\end{equation}

Therefore, with a small-signal step function at the input, we will observe a small-signal step function at the output.

\section{Bullet Point 11}
To determine the ideal output step for the various small-signal step inputs, I first had to simulate the closed loop gain of my circuit. To do this I constructed the circuit shown in Figure \ref{b11_gainschem} and acquired a gain of $A_{closed-loop} = 0.53V/V = -5.51dB$ (see Figure \ref{b11_gain}). I then set out to simulate the step response at various input magnitudes and sample at times $2\tau$ and $100Ts$. My transient step responses can be seen in Figure \ref{b11_step} and my voltage transfer characteristic for $V_{ideal}, V_{out1},$ and $V_{out2}$ can be seen in Figure \ref{b11_transfer}.

The absolute and percent errors are shown in the Chart \ref{b11_errors}.

I extended my step response plot for input steps of $\pm 100mV$, $\pm 200mV$, and $\pm 500mV$ to show the effects of slewing. As can be seen in Figure \ref{b13_step}, slewing is most obvious in the 500mV response.
